## Project Overview

Our Software Project team built a news article overlap detection platform, a project proposed by [Sourcer](https://getsourcer.com/about). The goal of this project was to create a unique approach to fight the
problem of finding the overlap in news articles. To solve this problem, we have implemented a user-accessible website interface for inputting text or news article links for analysis, and a backend server capable of
analysing and storing articles for future use.

The issue of identifying overlapping news articles became a course for concern in
the media sector, as journalists frequently encounter time constraints and the demand
to create unique and captivating content. The lack of such a tool at Sourcer and their
core values, including: "Contributing to a more informed society", led the client to challenge us towards developing such a system.
