# Review

## Overall
- Pipeline for build, checkstyle and tests passes (?)
- Checked pipeline log for code coverage, and it yielded: << branch_cov_percentage >>, as expected. 


## Code contribution
- << Discuss about different files that suffered important changes in MR >>




## Manual testing
- << Run different types of manual testing (i.e: Postman requests, add prints locally to check for expected behavior) to make sure everything works as expected >>


## Suggeestions
- << If any, indicate what you think should be improved; make sure to only point out things that are wrong / of bad quality, not equivalent things that you would implement differently >>
- << If possible, try to use the "start thread" feature from GitLab to provide feedback directly on code (comment on changes) >> 


## TODO
- [] TODO item 1


## Conclusion
- Well done @ << name >> , approved!
