# Review

## Overall
- Pipeline for build, checkstyle and tests passes (?)
- Checked pipeline log for code coverage, and it yielded: << branch_cov_percentage >>, as expected. 

## Review code changes
- << Discuss about different files that suffered important changes in MR >>




## Manual testing
- << Run different types of manual testing (i.e: Postman requests, add prints locally to check for expected behavior) to make sure everything works as expected >>

## Documentation

- << Verify that the documentation is up to date. Point out where documentation is missing and or needed >>

## Regression 
- << Assess the impact of the changes on other parts of the system. Try to explore a bit if other parts of the system still work as 
expected, so that no regression bugs have been introduced.>>

## Suggestions
- << If any, indicate what you think should be improved; make sure to only point out things that are wrong / of bad quality, not equivalent things that you would implement differently >>
- << If possible, try to use the "start thread" feature from GitLab to provide feedback directly on code (comment on changes) >> 
- << Provide feedback on the overall design and implementation.>>

## TODO
- [] TODO item 1


## Conclusion
- Well done @ << name >> , approved!
